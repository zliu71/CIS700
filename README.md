# CIS700 Final Project Neural Turing Machines
Please run the code on Colab!!! Very important!
Depends on your environment, this code may not work!
In this project, I use colab as the platform to implement the NTM with LSTM controller
There are two different versions, one is normal implement, 
the other is the special version for 3 different curves in the same plot\
Each file has been securely commented, can be read easily
To run the code, just download the file and upload to Colab
Remember, each time you run the code, the first cell must be executed!!!
You must run the first cell to initialize values
Otherwise this machine may still run the same externam memory!
